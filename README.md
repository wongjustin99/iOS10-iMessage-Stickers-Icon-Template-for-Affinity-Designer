 iOS iMessage stickers icon template for Affinity Designer

This is an Affinity Designer template with designated Artboards for all the necessary icon sizes that Xcode requires for Stickers apps for iOS 11.

I've attempted to label all the artboards in an easy way, so that when importing them into iTunes Connect, it's a simple match to each required file.

## Tell me if you used this template to make your iMessage Stickers

Please let me know if you used the template in making the icons for your iMessage stickers by [tweeting me at @fulltimeuser](https://twitter.com/fulltimeuser) on Twitter or creating an [issue](https://github.com/wongjustin99/iOS10-iMessage-Stickers-Icon-Template-for-Affinity-Designer/issues/new). I'll add it to this README to share with others. 

### Format when creating issue

Title: [Sticker pack] - Sticker pack name

Title for the new issue should have `[Sticker pack]` then a hyphen and the name of your sticker pack.

In the comment, place your app store link and a link to either your website or a public handle like Twitter.

## Buy me a glass of :whale:

If you found this Affinity Designer template helpful, would you buy me ~700 gallons of tap water (including sewage disposal fee)? I love being hydrated, and it helps me think clearer to make & share more things!
